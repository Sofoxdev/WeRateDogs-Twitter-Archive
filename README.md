# WeRateDogs Twitter Archive
## Introduction

The dataset I wrangled ,analyzed and visualized is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

The data was gathered from 3 different sources, directly downloaded the twitter archive dataset, used the requests library to download the tweet image prediction dataset and downloaded an additional data from Twitter API jsontext (tweet_json.txt)
